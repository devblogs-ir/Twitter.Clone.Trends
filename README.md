# Twitter Clone in ASP.NET Core
Welcome to the **Twitter Clone** repository! üëã

## Introduction

This project is a Twitter clone developed using ASP.NET Core, a powerful and cross-platform framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications. The goal of this Twitter clone is to provide a simplified version of the popular social media platform, allowing users to post tweets, follow other users, and engage in a microblogging experience.

This service stores, makes and manages trends. These trends are then filterable by country and continent.
